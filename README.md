      Reflection

    <p>
      The code was a challenge from Teens Exploring Technology. I am the developer of my team's app. Today all the developers had a challenge, which was to debugg the code. I have not finished debugging it but I will once I finish my app. Overall this challenge taught me something important. The first thing I did when debugging the code was running it on terminal. Terminal had said there was an error which I didn't pay attention and focused on the code. At the end of the day I learned that I should read and look up any problems in my terminal because Google is a place were I could research and find answers. I also learned that I shouldn't kill myself trying to degub something on my own when I could save time and research something to get a better understanding.
